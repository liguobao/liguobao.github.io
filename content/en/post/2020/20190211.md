# Chat Logs with My Grandparents

Part 1 — On Landlords

Me: It probably wasn’t them. In village XX (near my hometown) there was a landlord family. A classmate of mine is the great‑grandson; his grandfather (surname Deng) passed away when I was in high school. His grandma was the daughter of a landlord from another place. Deng Mingguang? Is that the person who owned the small three‑story cement house (whitewashed) in XX from the Republic era?

Grandpa: That would be Deng Mingguang’s son, right?

Grandma: It’s noon now — people are probably not around. (She chimed in; I don’t recall why.)

…

Part 2 — Fishing Nets

Me: Grandpa, how did you make fishing nets back then?

Grandpa: Hm?

Me: The nets you used for fishing — how were they made?

… (Original Chinese continues with daily life details; translated summary retained.)
