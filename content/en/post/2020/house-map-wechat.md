Previously I posted on V2EX about this tool:

- New interaction update for “Map‑based Rental Search”: https://www.v2ex.com/t/530011
- Scraped “City”‑tagged sublet/rental posts into the app: https://www.v2ex.com/t/509447#reply8
- Ad slot + major front‑end revamp + mini program live: https://www.v2ex.com/t/497674#reply4
- Map‑based rental search: https://house-map.cn/#/

This time it’s for real. The earlier mini program failed qualification; later I teamed up with a classmate to ship it.

## Features

### City listings

Screenshots show per‑city feeds and map overlays.

### Per‑platform views

Group sources (e.g., different sites) with individual tabs.

### Filtered search

- Filter by administrative district
- Filter by “within N days” recency
- Filter by listing type + price

### Listing details + map

Detail pages include map view/location.

### Favorites + feedback

Star listings and submit feedback in‑app.

### What’s new (Beta 9)

- District filters; city‑only fallback when no district
- “Within N days” filter
- Listing type filter; combined with price
- Show publish time in lists
- Bug fixes + new bugs
- Faster loads via caching
- Added an “ad” slot

### About the ad slot

It doesn’t earn much; cumulative project income over 2–3 years is around −¥10,000. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Follow the WeChat account “人生删除指南” to get the mini program, or scan the QR codes in the original post.
