Tried ASP.NET Core with a teammate — here’s a quick hands‑on note.

Environment: VS2015 Update 2 (any edition).

1) Download and install the .NET Core Runtime and SDK

https://www.microsoft.com/net/download

Grab both the .NET Core installer and the SDK, then install them (next, next, finish).

2) Install the VS2015 tooling (Preview 1 at the time)

“.NET Core Tooling Preview 1 for Visual Studio 2015”
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=798481

This one takes a bit longer — wait until it finishes.

3) Create a project

Open VS → New Project → Web. You should now see the ASP.NET Core templates available. Create a project and you’re set. We’ll dive into ASP.NET Core project structure next time.
