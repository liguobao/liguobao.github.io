## Part1

"The Sculpture Garden was planned to become Asia's largest sculpture-themed park, covering hundreds of acres, after arduous construction, it finally became unfinished. The biggest feature of this sculpture garden is that there is not a single sculpture."

"My Understanding of Life - Answering Questions from Tinglin Youth"
The initial memory about this place only comes from some article by Han Han.

Later around 2022, during Shanghai's "orderly" and "self-quarantine", one of the few areas where you could move freely was in the "countryside" of Jinshan District 70km from the city center, at that time you could still see reporters interviewing on the news broadcast.

Besides that, having lived in Shanghai for ten years, I had no concept of Jinshan at all.

Before having a car, places not covered by an hour's subway ride weren't places I wanted to go.

After having a car, places not reachable within an hour's drive need motivation and drive.

However, this spring weekend, after watching the cherry blossoms at night,

After sleeping well, it seemed like I could go out.

So I drove an hour to Tinglin Town.

The rapeseed flowers there are blooming, I can go see them.

After getting off the highway, I arrived at the rural path,

I roughly understood what kind of place this is.

Countryside.

Everything grows from the soil.

The land is a bit damp after the rain.

Small river flows by the village,

Broad beans planted in the roadside gaps,

Now blooming with black flowers.

Just like familiar countryside.

Just like the hometown I came from.

## Part2

After coming out of the countryside, I drove to the "real" Tinglin Town.

Looking around, it's basically the appearance of an ordinary southern town.

Probably won't associate with "Magic City" at all.

Opened Dianping, found a mutton restaurant opposite the parking lot.

After entering, couldn't see the menu, a bit confused.

But the boss and boss lady were very enthusiastic in receiving, after all, it looked like no one was eating in the afternoon.

Sat down listening to the boss recommending ways to eat mutton.

Half understanding, felt indifferent, just eat a mutton offal hotpot.

Soon the boss lady brought a pot of soup,

Mutton offal, blood, meat all there, white soup mixed with garlic sprouts tasted quite good.

Halfway through, the boss lady added a bowl of rice for us, just enough to eat.

Went through the long corridor inside the shop to the bathroom, saw there were several private rooms inside,

Although they don't seem to be used much now, the small shop must have been lively once.

It's just that the signboards are all rusty now.

## Part3

Probably won't go to Tinglin Town again.

Many places in life, you go once and that's it,

Meetings have their time, that's about it.

Some people can meet once more times.
