## Overall Strategy

- Answers first
- Ops team at the core; product+engineering driven
- Creator‑centric; creation is king
- Zhihu positions as a deep‑content community

## Product/Engineering Focus

- Treat moderators/answerers like community owners

### Recommendation Algorithm Updates

- Cold‑start optimization
- Objective shift for ranking
- Community governance (reduce flamebait/opposition; ~2% comments removed)
- Health of the ecosystem; encourage professional verticals

Past: PV/UV and traffic were king. Now: depth and interactions matter more.

### Hot List Experience

- Reduce confrontational topics
- Content ops strategy tweaks
- Product: remove “collapse”, add “featured”
- Question page ranking: suppress low quality; optimize TPR

#### True Positive Rate

True Positive Rate (TPR, recall/sensitivity) measures how well a classifier identifies positives: TPR = TP / (TP + FN). TPR ranking compares configurations/models by their TPR to choose better settings. In contexts like screening or fraud detection, high TPR is crucial.

### User Communication

- Feedback loops

### AI Content Stance

- Opinion extraction, similarity, quality, trust
- Plagiarism detection and enforcement
- Anti‑scraping (SEO shielding?)
- AIGC/Spam detection

Actions: restrict distribution; penalize malicious accounts. For Zhihu’s own “AI direct answers”: what sources were quoted to form the answer?

## Author Experience

### Good Questions

- Asking is somewhat de‑emphasized
- How are duplicates handled? Anti‑cheat for mass question spammers?

### Notifications

- Improvements to reminders

### Columns

- Upgrades, exposure, circulation, paid support
- What about Zhihu Daily?
- High SEO and content quality (reopen when?)

### AI Search / Direct Answers

- TBD
