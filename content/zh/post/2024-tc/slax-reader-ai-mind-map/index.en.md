Spotted an interesting browser extension recently — “Slax Reader”. Worth a quick recommendation.

An AI-powered browser extension that generates outlines and highlights key points to enhance your web reading experience.

Chrome Web Store:

A Python learning article I wrote earlier.

At the time of writing, the extension is free; the author mentioned typical usage isn’t heavy. It reportedly uses the OpenAI API, so it’s not exactly “cheap” behind the scenes.

For quick reads and skimming, the overall experience is solid — nice for building an overview.

Pretty neat — another way to save time while reading.
