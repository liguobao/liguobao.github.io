Welcome to the workplace theme park. Please follow the safety rules:

1) Power runs 24/7; diesel generators auto‑start during outages. Do not approach the power room if you hear loud bangs. Report any brown liquid seeping out to admin.

2) Power buttons are on top of cases; if yours is on the front, do not power on — leave early.

3) We provide 19‑inch MacBook Pros (silver only). If you get a black one, do not turn it on; return it to IT.

4) Pantry stocks Pepsi Zero only. If you see Coca‑Cola on sale, don’t try it — call admin. If you drank it, go to the clinic.

5) Turn off your monitor when leaving — save energy.

6) Do not shut down your PC — improve efficiency.

7) If the PC is off in the morning, hold power to boot. If it won’t boot, call IT. Don’t open the case or unplug it yourself.

8) If you see other monitors lit in the morning, note the number and leave; report if needed.

9) There are no robot dogs. If you see one, avoid and report.

10) Most programmers are introverts; avoid unnecessary small talk. If one initiates unusually, note their number and report.

11) Access control and face recognition are developed in‑house; only staff cards work. No outsiders can enter.

…

Why leave PCs on? Builds, background jobs, remote sessions, scheduled tasks, and long‑running dev tools keep working overnight. Monitors off saves power; machines on preserves context and avoids morning setup cost.
