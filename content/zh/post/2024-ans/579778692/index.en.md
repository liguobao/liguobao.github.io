Q: https://www.zhihu.com/question/579778692

A:

First, it’s not entirely true they haven’t. For everyday short‑video use, most creation happens on phones now. Many mobile apps handle both shooting and editing, and you can publish directly to platforms. In that scenario, phones have “replaced” PCs.

Apple even showcases iPhone‑shot films every year, with end‑to‑end shooting and editing on iPhone — a cool flex. In that context, a phone can indeed beat a PC.

But… broadly speaking, all of “us” here are computers — phones included. If you can’t beat them, join them. Phones are computers too; they’re a form factor under the umbrella of computing devices. One form factor replacing another is normal.

What the question really means is: why haven’t personal computers been replaced by phones?

My take:

1) Compute isn’t enough. For many workloads, phone SoCs still lag behind desktop/laptop CPUs/GPUs in sustained performance and thermal headroom.

2) Interaction isn’t enough. Touch-only UIs, small screens, limited input precision, multitasking constraints — all cap productivity for many tasks.

3) Ecosystem isn’t enough. Tooling, workflows, peripherals, and pro software ecosystems are still PC‑centric in many fields.

Overall, it likely takes another revolution — which might also end both as we know them. Just kidding (sort of).
